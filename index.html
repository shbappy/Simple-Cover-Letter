        <h2>Cover Letter</h2>
        <p><span>Spotify</span> has had a big impact on my daily life since it was released.
            <span>The application is always running in the background</span> when I train, work or relax.
             I feel that Spotify always contributes something to my days, independently of what
            I'm currently up to. When I <span>develop software</span>, I want to feel that I help create a better everyday life for many people, which <strong>I believe Spotify does</strong>, and that's why I'm writing this application.</p>
        <p>I am a <strong>humble developer</strong>. I strive to keep my code transparent and easy to understand. <strong>To enable more people to be involved</strong> in what I create and also question my code. To come up with the best possible solution, I believe that continuous feedback is the key to success and the way to go. I think this fits well with <span>how Spotify describes the way of working</span>, which I believe I could contribute to.</p>
        <p>When I develop, I always strive to make the code more efficient and easy to manage. I'm a doer rather than a questioner. When I code, <span>I start by doing and learn from what I observe</span>. I think this will make me fit well in a company like Spotify, where you value people who are <span>innovating</span>, <span>taking risks</span>, and where people have no fear of failure.</p>
        <p><strong>I would be delighted</strong> to discuss the various ways in which I could contribute to your team, and <span class="last">I look forward to hearing from you.</span></p>        <br>
        <p>Kind regards,</p>
        <p>Shakhawat Bappy</p>
